# Tensorflow loss function 

 This is for my study about Neural Network to deal with time series data, in particular, text. 
 
 Tensorflow has varous loss functions, sometime I make a mistake becuase I confuse api document

 So here I make an example for tensorflow loss. 


 1. tensorflow_softmax_cross_entropy.py - .
    
    - This example follows the [Tensorflow CRF exmaple for ver 1.15](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.15/tensorflow/contrib/crf)
