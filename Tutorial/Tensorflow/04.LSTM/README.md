# RNN(LSTM) and so on

 This is for my study about Neural Network to deal with time series data, in particular text. 
 
 I will hadle the RNN and LSTM model here. 

 The following is help site for those model, in partilcular LSTM.

 1. tensorflow_RNN_test.py - This shows process of RNN, LSTM and GRU with raw coding and tensorflow api
