# CRF (conditional random field) 

 This is for my study about Neural Network to deal with time series data, in particular, text. 
 
 Tensorflow CRF based on linear-chain CRF


 1. tensorflow_crf.py - This shows the process of tensorflow CRF example for investingating how to implement CRF in vector space.
    
    - This example follows the [Tensorflow CRF exmaple for ver 1.15](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.15/tensorflow/contrib/crf)
